[Cryptonomica](https://cryptonomica.net) offers user identity verification (for [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) etc.) for services such as banks, exchanges, financial companies, payment institutions.  

# Why it's better than to manage own identity verification procedure 

1) It's free for your service. 

2) It's managed by experienced lawyers. We also have [CIPP/E](https://iapp.org/certify/cippe/) certified Data Protection Officer. 

3) It can be easily and fast (in one evening) connected to your service 

4) It is more convenient for the user, eliminates the need to re-pass verification on different services 

5) It also can be used to sign and/or encrypt electronic documents sent to/from user. 

5) It can be used along with other verification/KYC methods/providers. 

# How it works 

You request our API for user data using user's key fingerprint provided by user. 

If user is not yet verified on Cryptonomica, you provide him/her link for verification with promocode (discount) for verification. 

# Cryptonomica user identification procedure 

Cryptonomica provides the most advanced online identity verification procedure on the market. More reliable than the one usually held when opening a bank account.

## Step 0

User has to log in to Cryptonomica [webapp](https://cryptonomica.net) with Google account (any email can be used to create Google account) 
Cryptonomica saves user email, google id, IP, browser and OS information. 

## Step 1

User has to provide two personal identifications documents. 
First: passport, this have to be passport with information on English. 
Second: another document containing a photo, first and last name in English and birth date, usually driving license. 
Documents have to be in color, and in good quality.

## Step 2

User records short video, where he/she reads provided verification text. 

## Step 3

Mobile phone number verification. User puts his/her phone number in international format into form, and sends to server. Than user receives sms-message with code in it and has to provide this code to proceed with verification.

## Step 4

User pays for verification with the credit/debit card with the same first and last name as in account (and as in passport). 
Credit/debit card data are processed by [Stripe](https://stripe.com), Cryptonomica does not receive an do not store card number and cvc/cvv. 
But Cryptonomica receive from Stripe and store last 4 numbers of card number, card exp. date, card holder's name, type of the card, billing address, issuing bank.

## Step 5

User has to check his/her credit card bank statement and to find description of the charge for key verification, it looks like: 'CRYPTONOMICA 6691170'. 
The last 7 digits is unique code that user has to enter in form on Cryptonomica website to prove that he/she is the legitimate owner of the credit card. 

## Step 6

All entered and recorded information has to be manually verified by Cryptonomica compliance officer. 
Compliance officer may ask user to provide additional verification data and/or short video-conference call via [Discord](https://discordapp.com), [Skype](https://www.skype.com) or other program for video-conferences. 

User's first and last name, birthdate, nationality, email and public key certificate will be published on Cryptonomica website and accessible for other users and services that use Cryptonomica API. 
Services approved by Cryptonomica can also obtain user's mobile phone number. 

Other data (such as scans of the documents, video, user IP address) entered in the verification process will not be published publicly, these data will be available only to: 1) employees of Cryptonomica Ltd. or persons having a service contract with the Cryptonomica Ltd, and only when it's necessary to ensure data validation and security 2) accredited notaries, 3) arbitrators of the arbitration court when resolving disputes involving a person whose key was verified. User can also grant access to this data to another registered user (witch also may represent financial or other regulated institution)

# How our API works 

Our API works on [Google Cloud Endpoints](https://cryptonomica-server.appspot.com/_ah/api/explorer).

1) We register you service and you receive serviceName (login) and apiKeyString (password) for access to our API

2) You send HTTP GET request like this : 

```sh

curl -X GET \
-H "serviceName:${serviceName}" \
-H "apiKeyString:${apiKeyString}" \
'https://cryptonomica-server.appspot.com/
_ah/api/pgpPublicKeyAPI/v1/getPGPPublicKeyByFingerprintWithApiKey
?fingerprint=05600EB8208485E6942666E06A7B21E2844C7980'

```

3) You'll get JSON with public key certificate data, like this:

```json

We also provide simple API to generate promo codes with discounts for your users: 

You send HTTP POST request: 

````sh

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -X POST -H "serviceName:${serviceName}" -H "apiKeyString:${apiKeyString}" \
'https://cryptonomica-server.appspot.com/_ah/api/stripePaymentsAPI/v1/createPromoCodeWithApiKey'

````

receive JSON: 

````json
	
{
"promoCode":"tv5EbZbskf3",
"discountInPercent": 50
}
	
````

and provide to user link like: https://www.cryptonomica.net/#!/promocode/ +${promoCode}

You can use webhooks to be notified about key revocation revocation. 

See how it implemented on: [stex.com](https://www.stex.com)

# Optional Ethereum address verification

Optionally user can verify itself as an owner of an address on the Ethereum blockchain, to use it in smart contracts and verified payments. 

You can obtain user information directly from [our smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x846942953c3b2A898F10DF1e32763A823bf6b27f#readContract) using your smart contract, [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [web3.js
](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API), [web3j](https://web3j.io) etc.

See how it implemented in [SONM](https://sonm.com) service: [docs.sonm.com/how-to/how-to-pass-kyc-by-cryptonomica](https://docs.sonm.com/how-to/how-to-pass-kyc-by-cryptonomica)
